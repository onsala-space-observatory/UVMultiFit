# Version history

## 3.0.0-patch2:

 - Replaced ms tool by tb tool in data I/O, due to problems with new
   ms tool.

## 3.0.0-patch1:

 - Solved problems with new ms tool in CASA > 5.x.

## 3.0.0:

 - Data arranged in a more efficient way (as complex arrays, which did
   not work in the older numpy C++ API versions (i.e., for CASA 5.X).

 - Gains to be fitted can be generic functions of frequency and time.

 - Helper Fringe-Fitting function (based on Quinn estimators of FFT peaks).

 - New examples in the test suite, i.e.:
     -  The "only_flux" functionality.
     -  A case of "immultifit".
     -  An example of Global Fringe Fitting.

## 2.2.1-r3:

 - Added extra info to the output file, regardin the use of
   primary-beam corrections.

 - The frequency written in the output file for fits to the continuum
   (i.e., when OneFitPerChannel is False) is now the AVERAGE frequency
   over the spws.

## 2.2.1-r2:

 - Corrected missing keywords in immultifit.
 - Adapted to CASA 5.x (so far)

## 2.2.1-r1:

 - Correction of small bug in the model-writting operation onto the
   measurement set (i.e., when write_model='model'

## 2.2.1:

 - Faster data read and model fitting (more efficient code). In some
   cases, the speed-up can even be of x2.

 - Improved w-term treatment in mosaics.

 - Added a "test suite" with some example cases.

 - New model (GaussianRing) and new parameter (HankelOrder), to work
   with models with no explicit Hankel transform (in these cases, the
   Bessel Function J0 is approximated with a Taylor series of
   HankelOrder order).

 - New keywords:

     -ldfac: to fine-tune the proportionality between FWHM of the primary beam
             and the dish diameter: FWHM = ldfac*lambda/D (default: 1.22)

     -phase_gains and amp_gains: to define parameterized antenna-gain
         functions, to be fitted simultaneously with the source parameters.

     -HankelOrder: to set the approximation degree of J0 in the expansion
         of source models with no explicit analytic form (new feature).


## 2.2.0-r4:

 - Corrected bug in "expo" model. It was not returning "major" as
   defined in the documentation (i.e., as the FWHM).

## 2.2.0-r3:

 - Added ichan and echan keywords to the "modelFromClean" function.

 - Changed "write_model" to "write", where "write" can be set to
   either '', 'model', or 'residuals'. The new 'residuals' feature
   saves the post-fit residuals into the CORRECTED column.

## 2.2.0-r1:

 - Changed pow(x,0.5) by sqrt in w-term correction. Speed-up by roughly
   a factor 3!

## 2.2.0:

 - Added "phase_center" keyword, for the user to specify the reference
   point on the sky to locate the model components.

 - Full support of W projection.

 - Better support for mosaic observations. Phase rotation is not needed
   anymore, but primary beams are still approximated using circular
   Gaussians (hence, the flux densities fitted to sources close to the
   edge of the primary beam(s) may be biased).

   In addition, the model components must be small, compared to the
   primary beams. If very large sources are to be fitted, please use
   the "immultifit" function, instead of "uvmultifit".


## PATCH 2.1.4-r3:

 - More precise estimates of derivatives for the Hessian matrix, when
   using spectral-line mode.

 - Re-fitting with fine tunning was broken. Now, it is back again.

## PATCH 2.1.4-r2:

 - The fit is not aborted if all visibilities of a frequency channel
   are flagged and OneFitPErChannel = True.

 - Added a clarifying message about re-scaling of weigths after the
   fit.

 - Corrected bug: the power index of the weights used in the fit was
   twice the one specified in "wgt_power". The effect of this bug on
   the fitted parameters is small (typically within 1 sigma). It is
   similar to a re-tunning of the "robust" parameter when imaging with
   the Briggs weighting.

## NEW IN 2.1.4:

 1. Changed two wrong explanations in the documentation (about meaning
    of pre-scaled reduced Chi-Squared and about relationship between
    axis-ratio definition and position angle)

 2. New keyword 'only_flux', to accelerate fits of many components
    with only their flux density as free parameter (e.g., for simple
    implementations of sparse-sampling deconvolution techniques)

 3. New keyword 'proper_motion', to correct for proper motions of fast
    moving sources (e.g., binary stars) during the fit, on-the-fly.

 4. Corrected bug that broke the possibility of using MJDrange. Now,
    if user wants to refit the dataset (e.g., with a new MJDrange) the
    fit() function shall be called with "reinit_model=False", to avoid
    memory leaks.

 TODO: Implement possibility of FITTING the proper motions.

## NEW IN 2.1.3:

 1. Improved convergence of Levenberg-Marquardt
 2. Simulated full-pol data can now be fitted with no problems.

## NEW IN 2.1.2:

 1. Corrected bug that gave flipped coordinate offsets in IMMULTIFIT

## NEW IN 2.01:

 1. Improved convergence of LM.

 2. Corrected bug that didn't read the coordinates shifts of mosaic
    observations IN NON-SIMULATED DATA.

## NEW IN 2.0b:

 1. Better memory handling in C++ extension.

 2. Faster processing (less overhead with Python API)

 3. Own implementation of Levenberg-Marquardt, to avoid the huge
    memory usage of the standard Scipy library (although at the cost
    of speed if the number of fitting parameters is large).

 4. Full support for CASA 4.2

 5. Added keywords LMtune and SMPtune, to tune the parameters that
    control the Levenberg-Marquardt and the Simplex algorithm,
    respectively.

 6. New feature in immultifit. Now, it also saves an image (cube) with
    the best-fit unconvolved model. BEWARE, however, of the "window
    effect", that will indeed convolve the model by the FT of the
    image FFT coverage.

 - REMOVED:

 1. Keyword clib is removed. Now, all processing is done with the C++
    extension. User must compile it as explained in the README file.

 2. Keywords rstep and rxtol are removed (now use the SMPtune keyword)

 3. The GUI has been removed (PySide doesn't seem to work well with
    the current CASA release. We will try to add it back in a future
    version).

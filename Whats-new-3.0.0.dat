MAIN NEW FEATURES IN UVMULTIFIT 3.0:

1. Both data read and fitting are now (quite) faster. Just look at the
timing in the "test suite" log files. For some examples (spectral-line
mode), the fits are a factor 3-4 faster.

The reason is that the data arrays are now read as arrays of
complex128 numbers, instead of separate double arrays for the real and
imaginary parts of the visibilities. I had to choose the former
approach because of the older API versions for numpy C++ libraries,
which had problems with pointers to complex numbers.

BUT if you have an old computer and encounter problems (or use use a
CASA version older than 5.0) and encounter problems, please ask me (or
downgrade your version of UVMULTIFIT to 2.2.1-r3).

2. The gain fitting (amplitude and phase) is now more mature. Even
Global Fringe Fitting (for VLBI) is working on some simple
datasets. More experimentation is on the way.

3. LMTune is now extended with another number (but the program is of
course backwards-compatible with previous versions for your current
scripts). The new value is the maximum allowed error for the FITTING
PARAMETERS (notice that in the previous versions, the same quantity
was assigned for the maximum error of the chisquare AND the
parameters). Besides, both conditions are now complementary (and not
inclusively mandatory), which may accelerate the fit (i.e., less
strict convergence criteria).

4. IMMULTIFIT has a new keyword (dBcut), to control the minimum
allowed gridded weights for the fitting (i.e., which values of the
gridded visibilities are discarded). The default cutoff in previous
versions was not very conservative (10dB), but this shouldn't affect
much the results.

5. A new function has been added (compilation is optional and
disconnected by default; look at the setup script) for finding fringe
peaks in delay-rate space and globalize the estimate as antenna-based
quantities (delay, rate, and phase). The model defined in UVMULTIFIT
(either the variable or the fixed one, or both) can be set as models
for the Fringe Fitting.

Currently, there is no documentation for the use of this function. But
you can contact me if you want to experiment with this. I'd like to
see how the UVMULTIFIT's GFF works on different VLBI observations!

No calibration tables are generated, but setting write='model' will
write the (gain-corrected) model, so that dividing the data by that
model will magically calibrate your delays, rates, and phases (there
is an example in the TEST SUITE).
